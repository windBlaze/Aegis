## TODO 

- [x] Handle exception when no wifi found & no route found - should be done differently 
when not on and on 
- [x] Look at Swift way of getting SSID & detecting when SSID changed 
- [x] Fix timers to work all the time... -> FIXED on 03/08 (added them in RunLoop)
- [x] Find a way to save user settings (db maybe)
- [x] Ask to permanently remember network and turn on auto 
- [ ] If set to remember, check with remembered MAC address and if changed put directly under attack 
- [ ] Keep last time for notifications when under attack to not get 1 million
- [ ] Look into repairing MAC address if under attack (static routes)
