## TODO 

1. Handle exception when no wifi found & no route found - should be done differently 
when not on and on 
2. Fix timers to work all the time... -> FIXED on 03/08 (added them in RunLoop)
3. Find a way to save user settings (db maybe)
4. Add SSID into the mix 
5. Ask to permanently remember network and turn on auto 
6. Look into repairing MAC address if under attack (static routes)
